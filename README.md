# Softpanorama collection of potentially useful sysadmin utilities

**This is a preannouncement**

This project is about publishing of a set of written by me over the years sysadmin utilities (this plan subject to change without notice).

**NOTE**: This page is not maintained often as I prefer HTML to Markup. See html version of this page [readme.shtml](http://softpanorama.org/Admin/Sp_admin_utils/index.shtml) for more recent and complete information.

## HISTORY

**Oct 26, 2020** *emergency_shutdown* utility was posted. The utility works with DRAC (passwordless login needs to be configured) and shutdown the server in N days if it detects a failed disk. Useful is RAID5 without spare drive is used.  

**Oct 19, 2020** *dormant_user_stats* utility was posted. The utility lists all users who were inactive for the specified number of days (default is 365). Calculates I-nodes usage too. Use dormant_user_stats -h for more information
