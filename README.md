** This is a preannouncement

This project is about a set of written by me over the years utilities (this plan subject to change without notice), which I eventually decided to publish in a hole that other can benefit from them too. 

**NOTE**: This page is not maintained often as I prefer HTML to Markup. See html version of this page [readme.shtml](https://github.com/softpano/admutils/readme.shtml) for more recent and complete information

##HISTORY##

[Oct 19, 2020] *dormant_user_stats* utility was posted. The utility lists all users who were inactive for the specified number of days (default is 365). Calculates I-nodes usage too. Use dormant_user_stats -h for more information
